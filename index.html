Senior staff author James Williamson reviews the structure of a typical HTML document, and shows how to section pages and format your content with HTML. Plus, learn how to create links and lists, and find out how HTML works with CSS and JavaScript to create rich, engaging user experiences. </p>

In this hands-on course—the first installment in an ongoing series—Christina Truong demonstrates the concepts that form the foundation of CSS, and explains how to use this language to add colors and other design elements to take your webpages beyond just black text on a white background. Christina covers selecting content, how the box model defines the spacing and sizing of page elements, styling text, and managing basic layouts. She also explores the tools needed to work with CSS, how to use selectors to target elements, and guidelines for page layouts with floats. </p>
